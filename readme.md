# Gene-Disease Assistant using TinyLlama

This project fine-tunes TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat on a gene-disease instruction dataset to build a lightweight assistant.
It also includes an optional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for improved answer generation.

---

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install transformers datasets peft accelerate bitsandbytes

2. Login to Hugging Face:
   huggingface-cli login

3. Place the 'gene_disease_rich.jsonl' file in the working directory.

---

## Fine-tuning

- Loads TinyLlama in 4-bit precision using bitsandbytes.
- Applies LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to attention layers.
- Fine-tunes on instruction-formatted prompts.
- Saves model checkpoints after each epoch.

---

## Inference

- After training, load the model and chat using a CLI interface.
- RAG module optionally looks up relevant data to improve answers.
